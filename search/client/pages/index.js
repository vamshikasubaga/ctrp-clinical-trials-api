                <p>Clinical trials are research studies that involve people. They are the final step in a long process that begins with research in the lab. Most treatments we use today are the results of past clinical trials.</p>
                <p>
                  Cancer clinical trials are designed to test new ways to treat cancer, find and diagnose cancer, and explore ways to prevent cancer.
